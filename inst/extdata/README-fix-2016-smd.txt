# Fix 2016 smd spreadsheet

1. Column names - copy from 2015 spreadsheet. Except for ISO NE CA tab which has
   one extra field (RegSP), that needs to be adjusted for.
2. Change Massachusetts tabs to SEMASS, WCMASS and NEMASSBOST.
3. Convert Hour column to numeric (select all problem cells and then convert all
   to numeric at once).
